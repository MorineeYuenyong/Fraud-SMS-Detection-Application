# Fraud-SMS-Detection-Application
## Project Overview
The SMS fraud detection application project aims to prevent users from falling victim to scams. It helps users identify fraudulent SMS messages and provides a tool to assess the credibility of incoming messages. The application collects user data to improve the accuracy of the Machine Learning model, addressing the growing issue of SMS scams. 

The Beebuzz application, designed for the Android operating system, detects suspicious SMS messages by using Natural Language Processing (NLP), a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI), to differentiate fraudulent SMS in both Thai and English. Users grant permission for the app to access their SMS messages and contacts, allowing the app to process the risk of received messages and links, alerting users to potential risks.

Additionally, the app can filter unwanted keywords, automatically removing and hiding messages containing those keywords from the userâ€™s view. The application provides accurate and reliable SMS predictions, fulfilling its goal of protecting users from becoming victims of fraud. It has been well-received by users, and feedback provided by users will be used to further develop the model and application in the future.
